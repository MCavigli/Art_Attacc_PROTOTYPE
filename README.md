# Art_Attacc_PROTOTYPE
This virtual reality experience is my final project for Holberton AR/VR specialization.

In this experience, the player can walk around a museum and destroy famous works of art. It uses Oculus-Unity integration and is developed specifically for the Oculus Quest.

Through this project I wanted to learn several different coding and Unity concepts. These concepts include working with colliders in VR, becoming more familiar with the OVR player controller, using distance grabbing, beginning with Unity's particle system and how it extends to scripting, becoming more familiar with audio in Unity, and incorporating and altering 3rd-party assets.


### Incomplete Features
* Information on the artwork. I'd like to set up a display that the user can read about each piece of art and an astonishing fact about it that really solidifies the horror over destroying it.
* Unique destruction for each piece of art. Each work should have a unique destruction animation. The glass covering the paintings should crack, and the canvas should tear. Statues should crumble in a realistic way.
* Multiple methods of destruction. As of now there is an axe the user needs to find and use to destroy the other works. Ultimately there will be **dozens** of items that can be used to destroy the art. This includes spray paint, a squirt gun filled with ink, a sledgehammer, a gun, and a painter's pallette. With the pallette the user will be able to paint directly on the art and add to it. The pallette should interpret the artwork being defaced and provide the user will a color pallette that fits the specific artwork.
